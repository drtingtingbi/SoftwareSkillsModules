# Group workflows with github

## Module Overview
A *GitHub Repository* is like a database for your software project. It stores changes, enables you to recover from disasters, and is the main staging area for the project team and client to access the product. In a group project all members of the group will be contributing code and documentation to the repository.  *Deployment* of software is everything we need to do to make it available to clients for use.  This workshop introduces a workflow to help you 1) avoid clashes 2) maintain a working code base and 3) deploy your software for clients.
