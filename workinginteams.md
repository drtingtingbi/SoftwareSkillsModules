Sample answer:
Diversity means that the individuals in the team have
a mix of di erent skills and backgrounds. Di erent backgrounds can
include gender, cultural background, sexual orientation, Di erent skills
include di erent levels of experience, knowledge of di erent technologies.
Additionally, different styles of communication, working and management
can lead to a diverse team.
One way diversity can help is bringing di erent skills and knowledge
and experiences to help solve a problem. For example, team members
with di erent background skills may see di erent solutions for the same
task. Likely some of these solutions will be better than others and, if
people are willing to listen, the team can choose the best one.
However, diversity does not solve everything. One problem is that
communication and expectations can be di cult for people from di erent
backgrounds. For example, language problems or social norms may make
some people unwilling to say they are late or unable to complete a task,
while others would be more forthright about this. If team members are
not aware of these di erent ways of communication then they will have
unnecessary conflicts.
